# EvanTheAstronautPico8
I made this game for my son who loves space and video games
It basically does nothing. You just fly around in space "visting" planets and the sun.
This is a work in progress. As he grows, I expect so will this game.
This is to be played on a pico-8 console. Find more information at: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php

This code is written in lua for the pico 8
